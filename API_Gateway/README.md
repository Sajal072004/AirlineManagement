frontend - middleEnd - backend

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices.

Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservices should actually respond to this request

We can do message validation , response transformation , rate limiting

we try to prepare an API gateway acts as this middle end.
